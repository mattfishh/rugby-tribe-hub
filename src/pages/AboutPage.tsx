            <p className="mb-4 text-team-silver">
              Founded in 2018, the Tavistock Trash Pandas Rugby Club emerged from a group of passionate rugby enthusiasts 
              determined to bring competitive rugby to our community. What started as casual training sessions at local 
              parks has evolved into one of the region's most respected rugby programs.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-team-silver">
              Our name, inspired by the tenacious and resourceful nature of raccoons (affectionately known as "trash pandas"), 
              represents our playing philosophy: adaptable, resilient, and surprisingly tactical. Just as raccoons 
              are known for their cleverness and versatility, our team approaches each match with strategic intelligence 
              and unwavering determination.
